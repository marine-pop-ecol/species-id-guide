# Species ID Guide Assignment 

Part 1:

For each species, create a two-sided 8 x 11-inch page composed completely of your original work that includes:

* A series of pictures and/or drawings that clearly shows the key features required to make a positive ID (including arrows pointing out where to look for key features, as seen in the best bird guides). This would be a good opportunity to show examples of some of the morphological variation (colour and shape) likely to be encountered in the field.
* A written description to aid in identification that includes a summary of the variation in colour and shape likely to be encountered in nature and descriptions of any look-alike species.
* Three questions per species (with diagrams or pictures to illustrate) whose answers together help unambiguously differentiate your species from other similar ones in the field. Examples of suitable questions could be: Does it have a groove at the anterior end (ventral side) of the shell? Do the plates on the top of the closed shell have a distinct zigzag along the midline where they meet? Do the last segments of its walking legs look like they have been dipped in blue paint?
* A one paragraph description of the species (i) current geographic distribution and habitat preferences, (ii) trophic role (including diet and foraging mode), and (iii) reproductive mode.

Part 2:

The final two pages of your ID Guide should include graphs of the morphological characteristics you measured for each species (Part C) and a summary table comparing the key information on size, morphology, trophic role and diet, and reproductive mode between the set of species.
D. Presentation (10pts)Permalink

Finally, you will give a 7-10 min presentation to aid your classmates in learning about the identification and ecology of your taxonomic group. An effective presentation will:

* Include a description of the results of your morphological study (including graphs, tables, diagrams, and pictures where appropriate)
* Give a summary of what you learned about how to tell your species apart in the field and their ecology.
* Have speaking contributions from all group members
* Effectively use images and diagrams and use text only to highly key points and label features.
